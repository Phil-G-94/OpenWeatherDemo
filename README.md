# OpenWeatherDemo

Weather display app leveraging OpenWeather API. Built using HTML, Bootstrap CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for any associated scripting. 

The interface allows the user to input the latitude and longitude for the location they would like to display the weather for. Alternatively, the user can pass their browser's coordinates as the input values, using the browser's built-in Geolocation functionality (if supported). 

Fetching the weather returns data for six categories: location, current temperature, min/max temperatures, what the weather feels like and humidity. This is displayed in card format using Bootstrap styling classes. 

## ToDo
- Change promise chain to async/await in API call function. 
- Add images representing current weather conditions to the display card. 
- Styling and layout improvements.
